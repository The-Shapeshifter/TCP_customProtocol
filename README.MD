This is a more or less simple program based on a client/server 
communication using TCP and some sort of error-handling and recovery
since the intended use is in a wireless communication with a somewhat 
tight window to send and receive data from both parts.
As a part of a wider system, this is intended to be only the custom
communication protocol and it is for study purpose only, it's in no way meant
to be revolutionary or used as a state of the art-thing.
It's to be intended as a POC for my last exam in the university that i am 
currently attending.
Feel free to give me any idea that you feel will make it better.
